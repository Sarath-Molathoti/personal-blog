        </div>

        <h1 class="headers-h1">What is a Port?</h1>
        <p>
          Ports are numerical identifiers for specific network services or
          applications. Each device or server uses ports to differentiate
          between different services (like email, web servers, file transfer,
          etc.). A device can have up to 65,536 ports, divided into well-known
          ports (0-1023), registered ports (1024-49151), and dynamic/private
          ports (49152-65535).
        </p>

        <h3 class="headers-h2">Well-Known Ports</h3>
        <p>These are commonly used for popular services:</p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Port 80: HTTP (web traffic)</li>
          <li>Port 443: HTTPS (secure web traffic)</li>
          <li>Port 22: SSH (secure shell for remote access)</li>
          <li>Port 21: FTP (file transfer protocol)</li>
          <li>Port 25: SMTP (email sending)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="headers-h2">Role in Ethical Hacking</h3>
        <p>
          Port Scanning: A fundamental technique in ethical hacking used to
          identify which ports are open on a target system. By discovering open
          ports, ethical hackers can identify services running on the system and
          determine if there are any vulnerabilities to exploit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tools like Nmap are often used to scan ports to see which services are
          exposed.
        </p>

        <h4>Open vs. Closed Ports</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Open Ports</b>: Actively accepting connections and can be a gateway
          for communication. They might be vulnerable if running an outdated or
          insecure service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Closed Ports</b>: Not accepting connections and usually secure from
          most basic external threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Filtering Ports</b>: Firewalls and other security measures can
          block or filter traffic on certain ports to prevent unauthorized
          access. Ethical hackers may need to test if firewall rules are
          properly configured.
        </p>

        <h1 class="headers-h1">What is Nmap?</h1>
        <p>
          Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source Linux
          command-line tool that is used to scan IP addresses and ports in a
          network and to detect installed applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nmap allows network admins to find which devices are running on their
          network, discover open ports and services, and detect vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gordon Lyon (pseudonym Fyodor) wrote Nmap as a tool to help map an
          entire network easily and to find its open ports and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nmap has become hugely popular, being featured in movies like The
          Matrix and the popular series Mr. Robot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ethical hackers use Nmap to identify live hosts on a network, open
          ports, running services, and even operating systems. It allows for
          different types of scans that can reveal detailed information about
          the target network without actively engaging (as in a passive scan) or
          with active probing (as in aggressive scanning).
        </p>

        <h3 class="headers-h2">Types of Scans in Nmap</h3>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            <b>SYN Scan</b>: Also known as "half-open" scanning, this is the
            most popular form of port scanning. It doesn't complete the TCP
            handshake, making it less detectable by firewalls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TCP Connect Scan</b>: This scan completes the TCP handshake,
            making it more likely to be logged but itâ€™s also more thorough.
          </li>
          <li><b>UDP Scan</b>: Used to check for open UDP ports.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Version Detection</b>: Determines the software version of
            services running on open ports.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>OS Detection</b>: Identifies the operating system running on a
            target machine.
          </li>
        </ul>

            By default, Nmap scans the 1,000 most commonly used TCP ports. These
            are known as the Top 1,000 well-known ports and are selected because
            they are most likely to be open and in use by services on a network.
            Nmap maintains a list of the 1,000 most popular ports based on
            research and usage statistics collected over time. These ports are
            considered the most likely to be open on a variety of systems, so
            scanning them by default is often sufficient to identify many open
            services.

            Performs a TCP SYN scan to identify open ports without completing
            the TCP handshake.
          </p>
          <h3>What is a Stealth Scan (SYN Scan)?</h3>

          <p>
            A stealth scan (also known as a half-open scan or SYN scan) is a
            type of port scanning technique used to probe target systems without
            completing the full TCP connection handshake. Its goal is to avoid
            detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls, making
            it more difficult for the target system to detect and log the scan.
            In a stealth scan (specifically, a SYN scan), the process only
            partially completes the TCP handshake:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>SYN:</strong> The attacker sends a SYN packet to the
              target to check if the port is open.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SYN-ACK or RST:</strong>
              <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc">
                <li>
                  If the port is open, the target responds with a SYN-ACK.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the port is closed, the target responds with an RST (reset)
                  packet.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No ACK:</strong> Instead of completing the handshake by
              sending an ACK, the attacker sends an RST (reset) packet to
              terminate the connection before itâ€™s fully established.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Because the connection is never fully established, this scan is
            considered "stealthy," as it leaves fewer traces in system logs
            compared to a full TCP connection. Many security devices are
            configured to log completed connections, but not incomplete ones,
            making this technique less detectable.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Characteristics of Stealth Scans</h3>

          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <strong>Avoids Full TCP Handshake:</strong> By not completing the
              handshake, the attacker reduces the risk of detection by security
              systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quick and Efficient:</strong> Stealth scans are fast and
              can cover a wide range of ports in a relatively short time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Less Intrusive:</strong> Because it doesn't fully engage
              the target service, itâ€™s often less disruptive than a full
              connection scan (such as a TCP connect scan).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoiding IDS/IPS Detection:</strong> Many Intrusion
              Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
              focus on fully established connections, which makes stealth scans
              harder to detect.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <b>Still Detectable</b>: Some modern security devices are
              configured to detect SYN scans.
            </li>
            <li><b>No UDP Scanning</b>: SYN scans work only for TCP ports.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            Runs a specific Nmap script against the target.
          </p>
          <h3>What Are Nmap Scripts?</h3>
          <p>
            Nmap scripts are written in the Lua programming language and are
            categorized based on their functionality. These scripts are executed
            during a scan and allow Nmap to perform tasks that go beyond basic
            port scanning. They can interact with open ports, services, and
            protocols to gather additional information or execute specific
            actions.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)?</h3>
          <p>
            The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is one of Nmapâ€™s most powerful and
            flexible features. It allows users to write and run scripts using
            the Lua programming language to automate network scanning tasks. NSE
            scripts can perform a wide range of functions, from basic network
            discovery to vulnerability detection and exploitation. This
            capability makes Nmap a versatile tool for security audits, network
            troubleshooting, and information gathering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nmap includes a large set of built-in NSE scripts, which are
            typically stored in the scripts directory of your Nmap installation.
            Additionally, you can download new scripts from the Nmap community
            or write your own.

          </h3>
          <p>
            To scan a group of IP addresses using Nmap, you have several options
            depending on how you want to define the group (i.e., ranges,
            subnets, or individual IPs).

        <h1 class="headers-h1">Role of Honeypots in Port Scanning</h1>
        <p>
          A honeypot is a computer system that appears to be a legitimate target
          for attackers, but is actually a trap used to gather information about
          cybercriminals. By analyzing how attackers interact with the honeypot,
          security teams can gain valuable insights into attack methods, tools,
          and strategies used by cybercriminals.
        </p>

        <h3 class="headers-h2">How Honeypots Work During Port Scanning</h3>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            <b>Attraction</b>: The honeypot is deliberately made to look
            vulnerable with open ports.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Logging and Monitoring</b>: When an attacker scans these ports
            and attempts to exploit the service, all their actions are logged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>No Real Impact</b>: Since it is a decoy system, the real network
            or systems are not impacted by the attack.
          </li>

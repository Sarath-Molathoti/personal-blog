        <p>
          Have you ever clicked on a button or link on a website, thinking it
          would do one thing, but it actually does something completely
          different? This could be an example of a clickjacking attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack," is when an attacker
          tricks you into clicking on something on a website that you didn’t
          intend to. This happens when a malicious website secretly places an
          invisible or hidden layer over a real, legitimate webpage. So, when
          you think you’re clicking on a harmless button, you’re actually
          clicking on something dangerous or performing an action you didn’t
          expect.
        </p>

        <h2>How Attackers Can Use Your Website in a Clickjacking Attack</h2>

        <h3>1. Embedding Your Website in an Iframe</h3>
        <p>
          An attacker could create a malicious webpage and embed your website
          inside an invisible or transparent iframe. An iframe is a tool used to
          load another webpage within a webpage. Here's how it could be misused:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            The attacker embeds your website within their own malicious page
            using an iframe.
          </li>
          <li>
            The iframe is either hidden, transparent, or positioned off-screen,
            making it invisible to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The attacker places deceptive buttons or links over the invisible
            iframe to lure users into clicking.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For instance, the attacker may display a button that says, "Click here
          to claim a free gift!" but instead of clicking the fake button, the
          user is actually clicking on a sensitive button within your website,
          such as "Submit payment" or "Delete account."
        </p>

        <h3>2. Performing Sensitive Actions on Your Site</h3>
        <p>
          Once users are unknowingly interacting with your website through the
          malicious iframe, they might perform actions such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Submitting forms (such as changing account information).</li>
          <li>
            Liking posts or following accounts on your social media platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Triggering payments or transactions (if your site handles financial
            information).
          </li>
          <li>Granting permissions or authorizing logins.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since the user thinks they're clicking on a harmless button, they are
          unaware that they're interacting with your website and performing
          these actions behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Your Users Become Victims</h3>
        <p>
          The attacker could target users of your site who have already logged
          in. For example:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            A user is logged into your website and visits the malicious site.
          </li>
          <li>
            The attacker uses the iframe to trick the user into performing
            actions while they are still authenticated on your site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since the user is logged in, your website may process these actions
            as legitimate requests coming from the user.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This can lead to unwanted account changes, financial losses, or even
          compromising the user's security.
        </p>

        <h2>Steps to Perform Clickjacking Test</h2>
        <p>
          The idea is to see if your application can be embedded in an iframe.
          If it loads in the iframe, it means your site is vulnerable to
          clickjacking. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to test:
        </p>

        <h3>Create the HTML File</h3>
        <p>
          Open a text editor (like Notepad, Sublime Text, or VS Code). Paste the
          following code into the file:
        </p>

        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Clickjacking Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a clickjacking test&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="http://your-development-server.com" width="100%" height="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          Replace <code>http://your-development-server.com</code> with the
          actual URL of your React application deployed on your development
          server. Save the file as <code>clickjacking_test.html</code> on your
          computer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open <code>clickjacking_test.html</code> file in your browser, check
          if your application loads inside the iframe.
        </p>

        <h3>Expected results:</h3>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            <strong>If the page loads successfully in the iframe:</strong> This
            indicates your application may be vulnerable to clickjacking.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img
          src="../../assets/clickjacking-sample-code.PNG"
          alt="clickjacking-sample-code"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />

        <img
          src="../../assets/clickjacking-sample-exec.PNG"
          alt="clickjacking-sample-exec"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />

        <p>
          To demonstrate how clickjacking works (in a controlled environment),
          you can add a transparent layer over an <code>iframe</code> to show
          how users could be tricked into clicking on its contents.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Code for Clickjacking Test</h3>
        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Clickjacking Simulation&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a clickjacking test&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 800px;"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="http://your-development-server.com" width="100%" height="800" style="position: absolute; z-index: 1;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 800px; background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3); z-index: 2;"&gt;
            &lt;a href="#" style="padding: 15px 30px; background-color: #28a745; color: white; text-decoration: none; font-size: 18px; border-radius: 
            5px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); text-align: center;""&gt;VIEW OFFERS&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          The above code overlays a semi-transparent red box over the
          <code>iframe</code>, simulating a clickjacking attack by tricking
          users into thinking they're clicking on something benign, while they
          might actually be clicking on a button or link inside the
          <code>iframe</code>.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../assets/clickjacking-extra-code.PNG"
          alt="clickjacking-EXTRA-code"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />

        <img
          src="../../assets/clickjacking-extra-exec.PNG"
          alt="clickjacking-extra-exec"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />

        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            <strong
              >If the page is blocked or does not load in the iframe:</strong
            >
            You should see a blank or error page within the iframe, indicating
            the site is protected (likely due to headers like X-Frame-Options or
            Content-Security-Policy).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For example, in Chrome Developer Tools (F12), you might see an error
          message like:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Refused to frame 'http://your-development-server.com' because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-ancestors 'self'".</code></pre>
        <pre><code>Refused to display 'http://your-development-server.com' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'DENY'.</code></pre>

          src="../../assets/clickjacking-handled-website.PNG"
          alt="clickjacking-handled-website"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />

          alt="clickjacking-handled-exec"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />
        <h2>Why Is This Dangerous for Your Website?</h2>
        <p>
          A clickjacking attack can seriously harm your website and its users.
          Here’s why:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            <strong>Loss of Trust:</strong> If users realize they were tricked
            into performing unintended actions on your website, they will lose
            trust in your platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security Breaches:</strong> Clickjacking can lead to
            security breaches, where attackers gain unauthorized access to
            sensitive data or accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> If your website is exploited in
            a clickjacking attack, it could damage your company’s reputation and
            lead to negative press.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Prevent Clickjacking on Your Website</h2>
        <p>
          Luckily, there are ways to protect your website from clickjacking
          attacks. Here are some best practices:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Use the X-Frame-Options Header</h3>
        <p>
          The X-Frame-Options HTTP header is a simple and effective way to
          prevent your website from being loaded inside an iframe, which is the
          main method attackers use for clickjacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set this header to "DENY" to block all iframes, or "SAMEORIGIN" to
          allow iframes only from your own domain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>X-Frame-Options: DENY</code></pre>

        <h3>2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP)</h3>
        <p>
          Another way to protect against clickjacking is by using the Content
          Security Policy (CSP) header. CSP can control which resources a
          webpage is allowed to load, including frames.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add the following directive to your website's CSP to prevent
          framing:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';</code></pre>

        <h3>3. Regularly Monitor Your Website for Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>
          It’s important to stay proactive about security. Regularly audit your
          website for vulnerabilities, and ensure your software and libraries
          are updated to their latest versions to minimize security risks.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Educate Your Users</h3>
        <p>
          Educating your users about potential risks can help them avoid falling
          victim to clickjacking attacks. Encourage them to be cautious when
          clicking on suspicious links or visiting untrustworthy websites.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Clickjacking is a sneaky attack that can exploit your website and harm
          your users. Attackers can embed your website in hidden frames and
          trick users into performing dangerous actions without realizing it. To
          prevent this, it's essential to implement security measures like the
          X-Frame-Options and CSP headers, as well as regularly monitor your
          website for vulnerabilities. By taking these precautions, you can
          protect your website and ensure a safer browsing experience for your
          users.

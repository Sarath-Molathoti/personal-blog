          In the world of distributed systems, where data needs to be stored and
          accessed across multiple servers or nodes, ensuring the system’s
          reliability, performance, and consistency can be quite challenging. To
          address these challenges, computer scientist Eric Brewer introduced
          the CAP theorem, which has become a fundamental concept in the design
          and operation of distributed systems. In this blog, we’ll delve into
          the CAP theorem, exploring what it is, its implications, and how it
          influences the design choices of distributed databases.
        </p>

        <h2>What is CAP Theorem?</h2>
        <p>
          The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer’s theorem, was introduced by
          Eric Brewer in 2000. The three letters in the CAP theorem stand for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: Consistency</li>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: Availability</li>
          <li><strong>P</strong>: Partition Tolerance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The theorem articulates the inherent trade-offs that exist when
          designing distributed systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Statement of CAP theorem</h3>
        <img
          src="../../assets/cap-theorm.webp"
          alt="CAP Theorm"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />
        <p>
          The CAP theorem states that it is not possible to guarantee all three
          of the desirable properties — consistency, availability, and partition
          tolerance at the same time in a distributed system with data
          replication.
        </p>

        <h3>Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          In a distributed system, consistency means that all nodes or replicas
          in the system have the same data at the same time. When a client reads
          data, it receives the most recent write or an error. In other words,
          there is no divergence in the data observed by different nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose we are working on a distributed system having client node and
          two database nodes say d1 and d2 . Now let’s say we have generated an
          update request to d1 and at the same time we have generated a read
          request at d2 . So here due to replication of data between d1 and d2
          we are able to access latest data . This is called consistency .
        </p>
        <img
          src="../../assets/cap-consistency.webp"
          alt="Consistency"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          Availability refers to the system’s ability to respond to client
          requests, even in the presence of node failures or network partitions.
          An available system ensures that every request eventually receives a
          response, though it doesn’t guarantee that the response contains the
          most recent data.
        </p>

        <h3>Partition Tolerance</h3>
        <p>
          Partition tolerance deals with the system’s ability to continue
          functioning even when network partitions occur. Network partitions can
          cause nodes to lose contact with one another, making communication and
          synchronization difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose somehow the connection between d1 and d2 breaks down now the
          replication of data will not occur hence consistency is not maintained
          but still both systems are generating output. This is partition
          tolerance. So even after connection breakdown the output is being
          generated by systems is partition tolerance.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../../assets/cap-partition-tolerance.webp"
          alt="Partition Tolerance"
          style="max-width: 100%"
        />
        <p>
          CAP theorem says that we cannot have all three properties i.e. C A P
          at same time we can have at most two at once . So let’s understand
          this . All possible combinations of consistency , availability and
          partition tolerance are CA (consistency + availability ) , AP
          (availability + partition tolerance ) and CP (consistency + partition
          tolerance ) .
        </p>

        <h2>CAP Theorem Combinations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CA (Consistency + Availability)</strong>: Here, the complete
            system is consistent and always available. However, if we break the
            connection between systems to introduce partition tolerance, we lose
            consistency.
          </li>
          <img
            src="../../assets/cap-ca.webp"
            alt="CAP CA"
            style="max-width: 100%"
          />
          <li>
            <strong>AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)</strong>: In this
            case, the system is partition tolerant and always available, but
            consistency is not guaranteed.
          </li>
          <img
            src="../../assets/cap-ap.webp"
            alt="CAP AP"
            style="max-width: 100%"
          />
          <li>
            <strong>CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)</strong>: This
            combination ensures consistency and partition tolerance but may
            sacrifice availability when a connection needs to be re-established.
          </li>
          <img
            src="../../assets/cap-cp.webp"
            alt="CAP CP"
            style="max-width: 100%"
          />
        </ul>

        <h3>Why is the CAP theorem important?</h3>
        <p>
          The CAP theorem is important because it forces developers to think
          carefully about the trade-offs they’re making when building a
          distributed system. When designing a distributed system, you have to
          decide which two properties are most important for your use case.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you’re building a banking application, consistency is
          likely to be the most important property because you can’t afford to
          have different account balances for different users. On the other
          hand, if you’re building a social media application, availability is
          likely to be the most important property because users will expect the
          application to be up and running all the time.
        </p>

        <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong>: DynamoDB is designed to provide
            high availability and partition tolerance, replicating data across
            multiple Availability Zones to ensure data durability and
            availability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Spanner</strong>: Google’s Spanner database is an
            example of a CP system, achieving strong consistency but with
            potential unavailability during network partitions.
          </li>
        </ul>

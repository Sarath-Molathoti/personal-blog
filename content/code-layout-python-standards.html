        <p>
          This article outlines best practices and coding standards for Python
          development. Python is a versatile and widely used programming
          language known for its readability and simplicity. To ensure code
          consistency and maintainability, it's essential to follow coding
          standards.
        </p>

        <h2>1.1 Code Layout</h2>

        <h3>1.1.1 File and Module Structure</h3>
        <h4>File Header</h4>
        <p>
          Every Python file should have a header at the beginning describing the
          file's purpose, author, creation date, and any other relevant
          information.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
"""
File Name : filename.py
Author : Your Name
Purpose : Brief description of the module's purpose.
Created Date: DD/MM/YYYY
"""
            </code></pre>
        <h4>File Naming</h4>
        <p>
          Use lowercase letters and underscores for file names. Modules should
          have a <code>.py</code> extension.
        </p>
        <h4>Module Import</h4>
        <p>Import modules and libraries at the top of the file.</p>

        <h3>1.1.2 Indentation</h3>
        <p>
          In Python, indentation is crucial for code readability and structure.
          It's customary to use four spaces for each level of indentation.
        </p>

        <h4>1.1.2.1 Vertical Alignment</h4>
        <p>
          When breaking lines inside parentheses, brackets, or braces, align the
          wrapped elements vertically with the opening delimiter.
        </p>
        <pre><code># Correct:
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)
# Wrong:
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.2.2 Hanging Indentation</h4>
        <p>
          If you choose to use a hanging indent, there should be no arguments on
          the first line. Further indentation should be used to clearly indicate
          it as a continuation line.
        </p>
        <pre><code># Correct:
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)
# Wrong:
def long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four):
    print(var_one)
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.2.3 Closing Brackets/Parentheses</h4>
        <p>
          When working with multiline constructs like lists or function calls,
          you have the flexibility to choose how to align the closing
          brace/bracket/parenthesis.
        </p>
        <pre><code># Closing aligns with the last element:
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
    'a', 'b', 'c',
    'd', 'e', 'f',
)
# Closing aligns with the start of the multiline construct:
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
    'a', 'b', 'c',
    'd', 'e', 'f',
)
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.2.4 Tabs/Spaces</h4>
        <p>
          It is recommended to utilize spaces consistently for indenting your
          code. However, if you find yourself in a situation where pre-existing
          code has been indented with tabs, it is permissible to continue using
          tabs in such cases to maintain consistency. Strictly prohibit the
          mixing of tabs and spaces for indentation, as it can lead to confusion
          and disarray in the code.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1.3 Maximum Line Length</h3>
        <p>
          It's a common practice to limit most code lines to 79 characters for
          readability. For lengthy text blocks like comments or docstrings, it's
          better to restrict them to 72 characters. This ensures code
          readability and makes side-by-side code comparisons easier during
          reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          While some teams might prefer longer lines, it's acceptable to extend
          the limit to 99 characters for code maintained by a consensus-driven
          team. However, comments and docstrings should still follow the
          72-character limit for consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          To break long lines, Python encourages the use of implied line
          continuation within parentheses, brackets, and braces instead of
          backslashes.
        </p>
        <pre><code>long_expression = (
    first_part_of_expression
    + second_part_of_expression
    + third_part_of_expression
)
# Backslashes are still appropriate in some cases, like assert statements:
assert some_condition, \
    "This is an assert statement with a long message that needs"
            </code></pre>

        <h3>1.1.4 Blank Lines</h3>
        <p>
          The use of blank lines serves to enhance code readability and
          organization:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Top-Level Definitions:</strong> When defining top-level
            functions and classes, it's customary to surround them with two
            blank lines. This helps distinguish them from the rest of the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Method Definitions:</strong> Inside a class, method
            definitions are usually separated by a single blank line. This
            maintains a clear structure within the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extra Blank Lines:</strong> It's acceptable to use extra
            blank lines sparingly to separate groups of related functions.
            However, these should be used judiciously and not excessively,
            especially when dealing with concise one-liner functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Logical Sections:</strong> Within functions, you may use
            blank lines sparingly to demarcate logical sections of your code.
            This can improve the readability and comprehension of the function's
            flow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>class EarthlyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        # Constructor logic here
        pass

    def method1(self):
        # Method 1 implementation
        pass

    def method2(self):
        # Method 2 implementation
        pass

# Extra blank lines can be used to separate related functions or
def unrelated_function():
    # Some unrelated functionality
    pass

# Within a function, blank lines can indicate logical sections:
def complex_function(input_data):
    # Section A: Data preprocessing
    processed_data = preprocess(input_data)
    # Section B: Main computation
    result = compute(processed_data)
    # Section C: Post-processing
    final_result = post_process(result)
    return final_result
            </code></pre>

        <h3>1.1.5 Line Break Placement with Binary Operators</h3>
        <p>
          There has long been a debate regarding the placement of line breaks in
          expressions involving binary operators. This choice can significantly
          impact code readability in two key ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Operator Scattering:</strong> When line breaks occur after
            binary operators, the operators tend to appear across different
            columns on the screen. This can make it challenging for developers
            to quickly associate each operator with its corresponding operands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operand Association:</strong> Placing operators at the end
            of a line separates them from their operands, potentially leading to
            confusion when discerning their relationships.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code># Incorrect:
# Operators are separated from their operands
result = (a +
          b -
          c *
          d /
          e)

# Correct:
# Facilitates easy matching of operators with operands
result = (a
          + b
          - c
          * d
          / e)
            </code></pre>

        <h3>1.1.6 Imports</h3>
        <p>
          Imports in Python serve as a crucial way to access external modules
          and libraries. Proper import practices enhance code readability and
          maintainability.
        </p>

        <h4>1.1.6.1 Separate Line Imports</h4>
        <p>
          Imports should be placed on separate lines, with one import statement
          per line. This approach enhances code clarity and makes it easier to
          manage imports.
        </p>
        <pre><code># Correct:
import math
import os

# Incorrect:
import os, math
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.6.2 Import Location</h4>
        <p>
          All import statements should appear at the beginning of your Python
          file, right after module comments and docstrings, and before any
          module-level variables or constants.
        </p>

        <h4>1.1.6.3 Group Imports</h4>
        <p>
          Organize your imports into three distinct groups with a blank line
          between them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard library imports.</li>
          <li>Third-party library imports.</li>
          <li>Local application or library-specific imports.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code># Standard library imports
import os
import sys

# Third-party library imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Local module imports
from my_module import module1, module2
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.6.4 Absolute vs. Relative Imports</h4>
        <p>
          For most cases, use absolute imports as they are more straightforward
          and robust. They also provide better error messages when the import
          system is misconfigured.
        </p>
        <pre><code># Absolute Import Example:
import datetime
from collections import Counter
from myapp import module_name

# Explicit Relative Import Example:
from . import utility
from .utility import helper_function
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.6.5 Handling Name Clashes</h4>
        <p>
          When imports might lead to name clashes, explicitly specify the
          imported names. This practice avoids ambiguity and ensures code
          clarity.
        </p>
        <pre><code>import myclass
import foo.bar.yourclass

# Use these imported names with their respective module prefixes
myclass.MyClass
yourclass.YourClass
            </code></pre>

        <h4>1.1.6.6 Avoid Wildcard Imports</h4>
        <p>
          Wildcard imports, like <code>from module import *</code>, should
          generally be avoided. They can make it unclear which names are in the
          namespace and confuse both humans and automated tools. Wildcard
          imports may have a rare use case when republishing an internal
          interface as part of a public API, but use them with caution and
          consider clarity and maintainability.
